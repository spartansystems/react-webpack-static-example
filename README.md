## Simple Static Site Generation Example

_How To:_

```bash
npm start
# => navigate to https://localhost:8888 and check it out!

npm run build
# => builds all the assets for deployment
```

This thing is still a bit rowdy, no tests, not quite "best practice" yet, but it
should get you where you need to be for setting up the
webpack-site-generator-webpack-plugin along with react-router
